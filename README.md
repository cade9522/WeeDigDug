*All .s files must be compiled together alongside the lab7wrapper.c file. Program made using Keil MDK Version 5 Developmen Kit. To run the program, you must use an LPC2138 microcontroller alongside it's accompanying universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) and general purpose input/output (GPIO). Setup for these devices can be found in the attached user manual (LPC2138_UserManual.pdf).*
